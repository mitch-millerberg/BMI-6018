#%% Instructions
'''
Overall instructions:
As described in the homework description, each graphic you make must:
   1. Have a thoughtful title
   2. Have clearly labelled axes 
   3. Be legible
   4. Not be a pie chart
I should be able to run your .py file and recreate the graphics without error.
As per usual, any helper variables or columns you create should be thoughtfully
named.
'''

#%% viz 1
'''
Create a visualization that shows all of the counties in Utah as a time series,
similar to the one shown in slide 22 during the lecture. The graphic should
-Show cases over time
-Have all counties plotted in a background color (something like grey)
-Have a single county plotted in a contrasting color (something not grey)
-Have well formatted dates as the X axis
'''

#%% viz 2
'''
Create a visualization that shows the contrast between the county in Utah with
the most cases to date to a county in Florida with the most cases to date.
The graphic should:
-Have only two counties plotted
-Highlight the difference between the two comparison counties
You may use any style of graphic you like as long as it is effective (dense)
and readable
'''

#%% viz 3
'''
Create a visualization that shows BOTH the running total of cases for a single
county AND the daily new cases. The graphic should:
-Use two y-axes (https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/two_scales.html)
-Use color to contrast the two series being plotted
-Have well formatted dates as the X axis
'''

#%% viz 4
'''
Create a visualization that shows a stacked bar chart of county contributions
to a given state's total cases. You may choose any state (or states).
(https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/bar_stacked.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-bar-stacked-py)
The graphic should:
-Have a single column delineate a state
-Have each 'slice' or column compontent represent a county
'''

#%% extra credit (5 points)
'''
Use Seaborn to create a grouped box plot of all reported states. Each boxplot
should be a distinct state. Have the states ordered from most cases (FL) to fewest 
cases. (https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/grouped_boxplot.html)
